# HIME Task Organizer

**High Impact, Minimum Effort** — a simple, browser-based task prioritization tool.

HIME helps you decide what to work on first by scoring tasks based on two factors:

- **Impact** — how much value completing the task delivers (1–10)
- **Ease** — how easy the task is to accomplish (1–10)

The **HIME Score** (Impact × Ease) surfaces the highest-value, lowest-friction tasks so you can focus on what matters most.

## Features

- Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks
- Adjust Impact and Ease sliders per task
- Sort tasks by HIME Score
- Completed tasks section with restore/delete
- Confetti celebration on task completion
- LocalStorage persistence — your tasks survive page refreshes
- Fully responsive, single-file HTML — no dependencies, no build step
